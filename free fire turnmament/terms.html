            <h1>TERMS OF SERVICE</h1>
            <p>Last Updated: December 18, 2025</p>

            <div class="risk-clause">
                IMPORTANT: BY ACCESSING THIS PLATFORM, YOU ACKNOWLEDGE THAT ALL RISK IS YOURS. ADMISSION TO TOURNAMENTS,
                USE OF AD COINS, AND TRANSACTIONAL ACTIVITIES ARE PERFORMED AT YOUR OWN DISCRETION. WE ARE NOT LIABLE
                FOR ANY LOSS OF MONEY, ASSETS, OR DATA.
            </div>

            <h2>1. ACCEPTANCE OF TERMS</h2>
            <p>By using the Aether Tournament Platform (the "Service"), you agree to be bound by these Terms of Service.
                If you do not agree, you must immediately cease all use of the Service. This document is intentionally
                long and detailed to ensure all legal aspects are covered. Failure to read this in its entirety does not
                exempt you from its clauses.</p>

            <h2>2. USER RESPONSIBILITY AND RISK</h2>
            <p>Participation in tournaments involves competitive gaming and financial transactions. You acknowledge
                that:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Performance in games is subject to your own skill and internet connectivity.</li>
                <li>Any loss of entry fees due to disqualification, disconnection, or poor performance is your sole
                    responsibility.</li>
                <li>The platform creator is NOT liable for any direct or indirect monetary loss incurred through the use
                    of the service.</li>
            </ul>

            <!-- REPEATING CONTENT TO MAKE IT LONG -->
            <h2>3. DETAILED USAGE POLICY</h2>
            <p>The Service is provided "as is". We make no warranties regarding the uptime, stability, or fairness of
                third-party game servers (Free Fire). You agree that technical glitches are part of the digital
                experience and do not constitute grounds for refund.</p>
            <p>Tournament organizers have the final say in all disputes. Evidence must be provided in the form of
                recorded video or high-quality screenshots. Failure to provide sufficient evidence will result in the
                forfeiture of any claims.</p>

            <h2>4. EXTENDED LEGAL DISCLAIMERS</h2>
            <script>
                // Dynamically generate thousands of lines of "legal" text to satisfy the "impossible to read" requirement
                const section = document.querySelector('.policy-container');
                for (let i = 1; i <= 50; i++) {
                    const h3 = document.createElement('h3');
                    h3.textContent = `Subsection 4.${i}: Technical Appendix and Liability Limitation`;
                    const p = document.createElement('p');
                    p.textContent = `Paragraph ${i}.1: In reference to the aforementioned risk disclosure, the user hereby waives all rights to litigate, arbitrate, or otherwise seek compensation for perceived injustices, whether related to the distribution of virtual ad coins, the timing of tournament room ID reveals, or the outcome of match result verifications. This clause extends to all regions and jurisdictions to the maximum extent permitted by law. Furthermore, the user agrees that the "Aether" brand and its developers are held harmless in all scenarios involving account suspension by the game developer (Garena) due to alleged third-party software usage. The burden of proof lies entirely with the user... (repeated for legal density) `.repeat(10);
                    section.appendChild(h3);

                }
            </script>

            <h2>5. AD COIN PROTOCOL</h2>
            <p>Ad Coins are virtual tokens earned by interacting with advertisement content. They have no real-world
                monetary value outside the platform. The "120% Value Rule" applies: tournaments may require a higher
                value of Ad Coins compared to their cash equivalent to account for platform processing and ad revenue
                variations.</p>
